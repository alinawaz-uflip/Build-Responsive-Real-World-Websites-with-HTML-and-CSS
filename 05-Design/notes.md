    - main color should match website personality
    - use a good color tone (open color, tailwindcss). Don't choose random tone or CSS named colors

    - create lighter and darker "versions"(tints and shades - tint and shade generator)

## When and how to use colors

    - use to add interesting accents or make entire components stand out
